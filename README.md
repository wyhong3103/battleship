# Battleship

Battleship is a game where you can place the ships on anywhere of the grid you want while following the rules for placement, basically, no ships can be placed adjacent to each other.

# Things I learned & Challenge I faced

- Unit testing with jest, I must say having tests in your code is a really good thing, everytime you made changes you can know whether your change break the code or no. Though I am not really good at it, but I tried my best to test every possible cases with the main code.
- Code organization, again, is not really good. I still have feelings that my code is a spaghetti. 
- Some frontend stuff is annoying, but I still managed to do it.
- AI's smart play is a little implementation heavy, but it's still fine I guess.

# Things undone

- Responsiveness (Of course)
